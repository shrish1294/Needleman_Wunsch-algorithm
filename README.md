# Needleman_Wunsch-algorithm
 I am solving this global alignment problem using Needleman_Wunsch approach which is a dynamic programming  approach. This algorithm looks for global maxima and finds all possible alignments having the highest score.
This algorithm is mostly used to solve sequencing problem and it has it's improtant in genetic sequencing.
